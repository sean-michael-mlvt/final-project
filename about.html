            <p class="floating-text m-2 p-2">The idea for Sight Seeker came to me after I took a picture of a squirrel on campus. It was sitting in a very pictureqsque tree, and as the squirrel ran off, I thought about how some people had probably never walked through this specific part of campus. I sent the picture to my friends and had them guess where it was taken. It was fun, and I realized it would be an interesting game to try and make.</p>
            <p class="floating-text m-2 p-2"> By the time the final project for NMIX 4010 (Intro to Web Development at UGA) came around, I had brainstormed more details about the web game and already decided that it would be a good personal project to do before the career fair in the fall. The broad selection of options in the final project guidelines allowed me to work on the game without feeling like I was sacrificing time away from school. In the end, it was the perfect opportunity for me to test new skills and challenge myself to create a proof-of-concept for my larger ideas </p>
